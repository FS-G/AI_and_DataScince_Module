# **Lecture 1: What is Machine Learning?**

## **1.1 Definition and Core Concepts**

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every task.

# **Lecture 2: The Three Pillars of Machine Learning**

## **2.1 Overview of ML Types**

Machine Learning is fundamentally divided into **three main paradigms** based on how algorithms learn from data:

1. **Supervised Learning** - Learning with a teacher
2. **Unsupervised Learning** - Finding hidden patterns
