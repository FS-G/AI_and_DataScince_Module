# Object-Oriented Programming in Python
## From Basics to Building Real Applications

---

## 1. Introduction to OOP

### What is Object-Oriented Programming?

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is like organizing your code the way we organize things in real life. Instead of writing everything in one big file, we create **classes** that represent real-world things.

Think about it this way:
- A **class** is like a **blueprint** or template
- An **object** is like a **house built from that blueprint**

### Why Use OOP?

1. **Code Reusability** - Write once, use many times
2. **Organization** - Keep related code together
3. **Real-world modeling** - Code that makes sense
4. **Easier maintenance** - Fix bugs in one place

### The Four Pillars of OOP

1. **Encapsulation** - Keeping data safe inside classes
2. **Inheritance** - Child classes getting features from parent classes
3. **Polymorphism** - Same method name, different behaviors
4. **Abstraction** - Hiding complex details

### A Simple Example: Why OOP Makes Life Easier

Let's see the difference between **procedural** (old way) and **object-oriented** (better way) code:

#### ❌ Without OOP - Everything Mixed Together

### Using Properties for Even Better Control

```python
# calculator_messy.py - The old, confusing way

# Variables scattered everywhere
num1 = 0
num2 = 0
result = 0
history = []

def add_numbers():
    global num1, num2, result, history
    result = num1 + num2
    history.append(f"{num1} + {num2} = {result}")
    return result

def subtract_numbers():
    global num1, num2, result, history
    result = num1 - num2
    history.append(f"{num1} - {num2} = {result}")
    return result

def show_history():
    global history
    for calculation in history:
        print(calculation)

def clear_history():
    global history
    history = []

# Using it (confusing!)
num1 = 10
num2 = 5
add_numbers()
print(f"Result: {result}")  # Wait, which result?

num1 = 20  # Oops, accidentally changed global variable
subtract_numbers()
print(f"Result: {result}")  # Now I'm confused!
```

#### ✅ With OOP - Clean and Organized

```python
# calculator_clean.py - The OOP way

class Calculator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.history = []
    
    def add(self, num1, num2):
        result = num1 + num2
        self.history.append(f"{num1} + {num2} = {result}")
        return result
    
    def subtract(self, num1, num2):
        result = num1 - num2
        self.history.append(f"{num1} - {num2} = {result}")
        return result
    
    def show_history(self):
        for calculation in self.history:
            print(calculation)
    
    def clear_history(self):
        self.history = []

# Using it (much clearer!)
my_calc = Calculator()
result1 = my_calc.add(10, 5)
result2 = my_calc.subtract(20, 3)

print(f"First result: {result1}")   # Clear and separate
print(f"Second result: {result2}")  # No confusion!

my_calc.show_history()  # See what we did
```

### Why the OOP Version is Better

1. **No Global Variables** - Everything stays organized inside the class
2. **Clear Ownership** - Each calculator has its own history
3. **Easy to Use** - `my_calc.add(5, 3)` is much clearer
4. **No Accidents** - Can't accidentally mess up someone else's calculator
5. **Reusable** - Can create multiple calculators easily

```python
# Multiple calculators - impossible with the messy version!
work_calc = Calculator()
personal_calc = Calculator()

work_calc.add(100, 200)
personal_calc.add(5, 10)

# Each keeps its own history - no mixing up!
```

**This is the power of OOP** - it takes messy, confusing code and makes it **clean, organized, and logical**!

## 2. Creating Your First Class

Let's start with something everyone can understand - a **Student**!

### Basic Class Structure

```python
# student.py
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.grades = []
    
    def add_grade(self, grade):
        self.grades.append(grade)
    
    def get_average(self):
        if len(self.grades) == 0:
            return 0
        return sum(self.grades) / len(self.grades)
    
    def introduce(self):
        return f"Hi! I'm {self.name} and I'm {self.age} years old."
```

### Key Components Explained

- **`class Student:`** - This creates our blueprint
- **`__init__`** - This is the **constructor**, it runs when we create a new student
- **`self`** - This refers to the **current object**
- **`self.name`** - This is an **attribute** (property) of the student
- **Methods** - These are **functions** inside the class

### Using Our Student Class

```python
# test_student.py
from student import Student

# Creating objects (instances)
john = Student("John", 20)
mary = Student("Mary", 19)

# Using methods
print(john.introduce())  # Hi! I'm John and I'm 20 years old.
print(mary.introduce())  # Hi! I'm Mary and I'm 19 years old.

# Adding grades
john.add_grade(85)
john.add_grade(92)
john.add_grade(78)

print(f"John's average: {john.get_average()}")  # John's average: 85.0
```

### 🎯 Practical Exercise 1
Create a `Book` class with:
- Attributes: title, author, pages
- Methods: get_info(), mark_as_read()

#### Solution:

```python
# book_exercise.py
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author, pages):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.pages = pages
        self.is_read = False  # Track reading status
    
    def get_info(self):
        status = "Read" if self.is_read else "Not read yet"
        return f"'{self.title}' by {self.author} - {self.pages} pages ({status})"
    
    def mark_as_read(self):
        self.is_read = True
        return f"You finished reading '{self.title}'!"

# Test the Book class
book1 = Book("Python Basics", "John Smith", 250)
book2 = Book("Web Development", "Jane Doe", 400)

print(book1.get_info())  # 'Python Basics' by John Smith - 250 pages (Not read yet)
print(book1.mark_as_read())  # You finished reading 'Python Basics'!
print(book1.get_info())  # 'Python Basics' by John Smith - 250 pages (Read)
```

---

## 3. Understanding Objects and Methods

### Objects are Independent

Each **object** has its own **data**. When we create two students, they don't share grades:

```python
# Different students, different data
student1 = Student("Alice", 20)
student2 = Student("Bob", 21)

student1.add_grade(90)
student2.add_grade(75)

print(student1.get_average())  # 90.0
print(student2.get_average())  # 75.0
```

### Method Types

Understanding the **three types of methods** in Python classes:

1. **Instance Methods** - Work with **specific object data** (most common)
   - Use `self` to access object's data
   - Each object can have different results
   - Example: `student.get_average()` - each student has different grades

2. **Class Methods** - Work with **class-level data** (shared by all objects)
   - Use `@classmethod` decorator and `cls` parameter
   - Same result for all objects of that class
   - Example: `Student.get_school_info()` - same school for all students

3. **Static Methods** - **Don't need object or class data** (utility functions)
   - Use `@staticmethod` decorator, no `self` or `cls`
   - Work like regular functions but belong to the class
   - Example: `Student.is_passing_grade(75)` - just checks if 75 is passing

```python
class Student:
    # Class variables - shared by ALL students
    school_name = "Python University"
    total_students = 0
    
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Instance variable - unique to each student
        self.age = age    # Instance variable - unique to each student
        self.grades = []  # Instance variable - unique to each student
        Student.total_students += 1  # Update class variable
    
    # INSTANCE METHOD - works with THIS student's data
    def add_grade(self, grade):
        """Add a grade to THIS student's grade list"""
        self.grades.append(grade)  # Uses self - specific to this student
        return f"{self.name} received grade: {grade}"
    
    # INSTANCE METHOD - works with THIS student's data
    def get_average(self):
        """Calculate THIS student's average"""
        if len(self.grades) == 0:
            return 0
        return sum(self.grades) / len(self.grades)  # Uses self.grades
    
    # CLASS METHOD - works with data shared by ALL students
    @classmethod
    def get_school_info(cls):
        """Get information about the school - same for ALL students"""
        return f"School: {cls.school_name}, Total Students: {cls.total_students}"
    
    # STATIC METHOD - doesn't need ANY student data
    @staticmethod
    def is_passing_grade(grade):
        """Check if a grade is passing - works without any student object"""
        return grade >= 60  # Just a utility function
    
    # STATIC METHOD - doesn't need ANY student data  
    @staticmethod
    def grade_letter(grade):
        """Convert number grade to letter - works without any student object"""
        if grade >= 90: return 'A'
        elif grade >= 80: return 'B'
        elif grade >= 70: return 'C'
        elif grade >= 60: return 'D'
        else: return 'F'

# Let's see the differences in action!

# Create some students (each has their own data)
john = Student("John", 20)
mary = Student("Mary", 19)

# INSTANCE METHODS - different results for different students
john.add_grade(85)
john.add_grade(92)
mary.add_grade(78)
mary.add_grade(95)

print("=== INSTANCE METHODS ===")
print(f"John's average: {john.get_average()}")  # 88.5
print(f"Mary's average: {mary.get_average()}")  # 86.5 - Different result!

# CLASS METHODS - same result no matter which student calls it
print("\n=== CLASS METHODS ===")
print(john.get_school_info())  # Same school info
print(mary.get_school_info())  # Exactly the same!
print(Student.get_school_info())  # Can call directly on class too!

# STATIC METHODS - work without any student object
print("\n=== STATIC METHODS ===")
print(f"Is 75 passing? {Student.is_passing_grade(75)}")  # True
print(f"Is 45 passing? {Student.is_passing_grade(45)}")  # False
print(f"Grade 87 is: {Student.grade_letter(87)}")       # B

# Static methods can be called from instances too (but don't need to be)
print(f"From John: Is 85 passing? {john.is_passing_grade(85)}")  # True
```

### When to Use Each Type?

**🎯 Use Instance Methods when:**
- You need to work with specific object data
- Each object might give different results
- Examples: `calculate_balance()`, `get_name()`, `add_item()`

**🏫 Use Class Methods when:**
- You need to work with data shared by all objects
- You want to create objects in special ways (factory methods)
- Examples: `get_total_count()`, `create_from_file()`, `get_default_settings()`

**🔧 Use Static Methods when:**
- You have a utility function that belongs with the class
- You don't need any object or class data
- Examples: `is_valid_email()`, `convert_temperature()`, `calculate_tax()`

---

## 4. Encapsulation - Keeping Data and Methods Safe

**Encapsulation** means keeping some data **and methods** **private** so they can't be accidentally used or changed from outside the class.

### The Problem Without Encapsulation

```python
# Bad example - anyone can change the balance directly
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance):
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance  # This is public - anyone can change it!

# This is dangerous!
account = BankAccount("John", 1000)
account.balance = -5000  # Oops! Negative balance
```

### The Solution - Private Attributes and Methods

```python
# bank_account.py
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, initial_balance):
        self.owner = owner
        self.__balance = initial_balance  # Private attribute (double underscore)
    
    def deposit(self, amount):
        if self.__is_valid_amount(amount):  # Using private method
            self.__balance += amount
            self.__log_transaction(f"Deposited ${amount}")  # Using private method
            return f"Deposited ${amount}. New balance: ${self.__balance}"
        return "Deposit amount must be positive"
    
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if self.__is_valid_amount(amount) and amount <= self.__balance:
            self.__balance -= amount
            self.__log_transaction(f"Withdrew ${amount}")  # Using private method
            return f"Withdrew ${amount}. New balance: ${self.__balance}"
        return "Invalid withdrawal amount"
    
    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance
    
    def get_account_info(self):
        return f"Account Owner: {self.owner}, Balance: ${self.__balance}"
    
    # PRIVATE METHODS - only used inside the class
    def __is_valid_amount(self, amount):
        """Check if amount is valid - internal use only"""
        return amount > 0 and isinstance(amount, (int, float))
    
    def __log_transaction(self, message):
        """Log transaction details - internal use only"""
        print(f"[INTERNAL LOG] {self.owner}: {message}")
    
    def __calculate_interest(self, rate):
        """Calculate interest - complex internal logic"""
        return self.__balance * rate * 0.01

# Usage - shows what's accessible from outside
account = BankAccount("John", 1000)

# ✅ These work - public methods
print(account.deposit(200))
print(account.get_balance())

# ❌ These don't work - private methods are hidden
# account.__is_valid_amount(100)      # AttributeError!
# account.__log_transaction("test")   # AttributeError!
# account.__calculate_interest(5)     # AttributeError!
```

### Why Encapsulate Methods Too?

**Private methods** help us:

1. **Hide Complex Logic** - Users don't need to know how interest is calculated
2. **Prevent Misuse** - Can't accidentally call internal validation functions
3. **Keep Code Clean** - Only show methods that users actually need
4. **Easy to Change** - Can modify private methods without breaking user code

```python
class Calculator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.history = []
    
    # PUBLIC METHOD - users can call this
    def calculate_mortgage(self, principal, rate, years):
        """Calculate monthly mortgage payment"""
        monthly_rate = self.__annual_to_monthly_rate(rate)  # Private method
        num_payments = self.__years_to_payments(years)      # Private method
        
        if monthly_rate == 0:
            return principal / num_payments
        
        payment = self.__mortgage_formula(principal, monthly_rate, num_payments)  # Private
        self.__add_to_history(f"Mortgage calculation: ${payment:.2f}/month")     # Private
        return payment
    
    # PRIVATE METHODS - internal calculations only
    def __annual_to_monthly_rate(self, annual_rate):
        """Convert annual rate to monthly - internal use only"""
        return annual_rate / 100 / 12
    
    def __years_to_payments(self, years):
        """Convert years to number of payments - internal use only"""
        return years * 12
    
    def __mortgage_formula(self, principal, rate, payments):
        """Complex mortgage formula - internal use only"""
        return principal * (rate * (1 + rate)**payments) / ((1 + rate)**payments - 1)
    
    def __add_to_history(self, entry):
        """Add entry to calculation history - internal use only"""
        self.history.append(entry)

# User only needs to know about the public method
calc = Calculator()
payment = calc.calculate_mortgage(200000, 5.5, 30)
print(f"Monthly payment: ${payment:.2f}")

# All the complex internal stuff is hidden and protected!
```

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, initial_balance):
        self.owner = owner
        self.__balance = initial_balance
    
    @property
    def balance(self):
        return self.__balance
    
    @balance.setter
    def balance(self, amount):
        if amount >= 0:
            self.__balance = amount
        else:
            print("Balance cannot be negative!")

# Usage
account = BankAccount("John", 1000)
print(account.balance)  # 1000 (using getter)
account.balance = 1500  # Using setter
account.balance = -100  # This will show error message
```

### 🎯 Practical Exercise 2

```python
# banking_demo.py
from bank_account import BankAccount

def main():
    # Create account
    my_account = BankAccount("Alice", 500)
    
    # Simulate banking operations
    print(my_account.get_account_info())
    print(my_account.deposit(200))
    print(my_account.withdraw(100))
    print(my_account.withdraw(1000))  # This should fail
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## 5. Inheritance - Reusing Code Smartly

**Inheritance** lets us create **child classes** that get features from **parent classes**. It's like how children inherit traits from their parents.

### Basic Inheritance Example

```python
# vehicles.py
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, brand, model, year):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
        self.is_running = False
    
    def start(self):
        self.is_running = True
        return f"{self.brand} {self.model} is now running"
    
    def stop(self):
        self.is_running = False
        return f"{self.brand} {self.model} has stopped"
    
    def get_info(self):
        return f"{self.year} {self.brand} {self.model}"

# Child class inherits from Vehicle
class Car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, brand, model, year, doors):
        super().__init__(brand, model, year)  # Call parent constructor
        self.doors = doors
    
    def honk(self):
        return "Beep beep!"
    
    def get_info(self):
        parent_info = super().get_info()
        return f"{parent_info} - {self.doors} doors"

class Motorcycle(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, brand, model, year, engine_size):
        super().__init__(brand, model, year)
        self.engine_size = engine_size
    
    def rev_engine(self):
        return "Vroom vroom!"
    
    def get_info(self):
        parent_info = super().get_info()
        return f"{parent_info} - {self.engine_size}cc engine"
```

### Using Inherited Classes

```python
# vehicle_demo.py
from vehicles import Vehicle, Car, Motorcycle

def main():
    # Create different vehicles
    my_car = Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2023, 4)
    my_bike = Motorcycle("Honda", "CBR", 2022, 600)
    
    # All vehicles can start and stop
    print(my_car.start())
    print(my_bike.start())
    
    # Each has unique methods
    print(my_car.honk())
    print(my_bike.rev_engine())
    
    # Overridden methods work differently
    print(my_car.get_info())
    print(my_bike.get_info())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Types of Inheritance

1. **Single Inheritance** - One parent, one child
2. **Multiple Inheritance** - One child, multiple parents
3. **Multilevel Inheritance** - Grandparent → Parent → Child

```python
# Example of multilevel inheritance
class Animal:
    def breathe(self):
        return "Breathing..."

class Mammal(Animal):
    def feed_milk(self):
        return "Feeding milk to babies"

class Dog(Mammal):
    def bark(self):
        return "Woof!"

# Dog inherits from both Mammal and Animal
my_dog = Dog()
print(my_dog.breathe())     # From Animal
print(my_dog.feed_milk())   # From Mammal
print(my_dog.bark())        # From Dog
```

---

## 6. Polymorphism - Same Name, Different Behavior

**Polymorphism** means **"many forms"**. The same method name can do different things in different classes.

### Polymorphism with Shapes

```python
# shapes.py
import math

class Shape:
    def area(self):
        pass
    
    def perimeter(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
    
    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height
    
    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.width + self.height)

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius
    
    def area(self):
        return math.pi * self.radius ** 2
    
    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * math.pi * self.radius

class Triangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, base, height, side1, side2):
        self.base = base
        self.height = height
        self.side1 = side1
        self.side2 = side2
    
    def area(self):
        return 0.5 * self.base * self.height
    
    def perimeter(self):
        return self.base + self.side1 + self.side2
```

### Using Polymorphism

```python
# shape_calculator.py
from shapes import Rectangle, Circle, Triangle

def calculate_shape_info(shape):
    """This function works with ANY shape!"""
    print(f"Shape: {shape.__class__.__name__}")
    print(f"Area: {shape.area():.2f}")
    print(f"Perimeter: {shape.perimeter():.2f}")
    print("-" * 30)

def main():
    # Create different shapes
    shapes = [
        Rectangle(5, 3),
        Circle(4),
        Triangle(6, 4, 5, 5)
    ]
    
    # Same function works with all shapes!
    for shape in shapes:
        calculate_shape_info(shape)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Method Overloading Alternative

Python doesn't have traditional method overloading, but we can simulate it:

```python
class Calculator:
    def add(self, *args):
        if len(args) == 2:
            return args[0] + args[1]
        elif len(args) == 3:
            return args[0] + args[1] + args[2]
        else:
            return sum(args)

calc = Calculator()
print(calc.add(5, 3))        # 8
print(calc.add(1, 2, 3))     # 6
print(calc.add(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))  # 15
```

---

## 7. Building a Complete Application

Now let's build a **Library Management System** that uses all OOP concepts!

### Step 1: The Book Class

```python
# book.py
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author, isbn):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.isbn = isbn
        self.is_borrowed = False
        self.borrowed_by = None
    
    def borrow(self, member_name):
        if not self.is_borrowed:
            self.is_borrowed = True
            self.borrowed_by = member_name
            return f"'{self.title}' borrowed by {member_name}"
        return f"'{self.title}' is already borrowed"
    
    def return_book(self):
        if self.is_borrowed:
            borrower = self.borrowed_by
            self.is_borrowed = False
            self.borrowed_by = None
            return f"'{self.title}' returned by {borrower}"
        return f"'{self.title}' was not borrowed"
    
    def get_info(self):
        status = "Available" if not self.is_borrowed else f"Borrowed by {self.borrowed_by}"
        return f"'{self.title}' by {self.author} - {status}"
```

### Step 2: The Member Class

```python
# member.py
class Member:
    def __init__(self, name, member_id):
        self.name = name
        self.member_id = member_id
        self.borrowed_books = []
    
    def borrow_book(self, book):
        if len(self.borrowed_books) < 3:  # Max 3 books
            result = book.borrow(self.name)
            if "borrowed by" in result:
                self.borrowed_books.append(book)
            return result
        return "Cannot borrow more than 3 books"
    
    def return_book(self, book):
        if book in self.borrowed_books:
            result = book.return_book()
            self.borrowed_books.remove(book)
            return result
        return "You haven't borrowed this book"
    
    def get_borrowed_books(self):
        if not self.borrowed_books:
            return f"{self.name} has no borrowed books"
        
        books_list = [book.title for book in self.borrowed_books]
        return f"{self.name} has borrowed: {', '.join(books_list)}"
```

### Step 3: The Library Class (Composition)

```python
# library.py
from book import Book
from member import Member

class Library:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.books = []
        self.members = []
    
    def add_book(self, title, author, isbn):
        book = Book(title, author, isbn)
        self.books.append(book)
        return f"Added '{title}' to library"
    
    def add_member(self, name, member_id):
        member = Member(name, member_id)
        self.members.append(member)
        return f"Added member: {name}"
    
    def find_book(self, title):
        for book in self.books:
            if book.title.lower() == title.lower():
                return book
        return None
    
    def find_member(self, member_id):
        for member in self.members:
            if member.member_id == member_id:
                return member
        return None
    
    def show_all_books(self):
        if not self.books:
            return "No books in library"
        
        result = f"\n=== {self.name} Library Books ===\n"
        for book in self.books:
            result += book.get_info() + "\n"
        return result
    
    def show_available_books(self):
        available = [book for book in self.books if not book.is_borrowed]
        
        if not available:
            return "No books available"
        
        result = f"\n=== Available Books ===\n"
        for book in available:
            result += book.get_info() + "\n"
        return result
```

### Step 4: Main Application

```python
# main.py
from library import Library

def main():
    # Create library
    lib = Library("City Central")
    
    # Add some books
    lib.add_book("Python Programming", "John Smith", "123456789")
    lib.add_book("Web Development", "Jane Doe", "987654321")
    lib.add_book("Data Science", "Bob Wilson", "456789123")
    
    # Add members
    lib.add_member("Alice Johnson", "M001")
    lib.add_member("Charlie Brown", "M002")
    
    # Show all books
    print(lib.show_all_books())
    
    # Find members and books
    alice = lib.find_member("M001")
    python_book = lib.find_book("Python Programming")
    web_book = lib.find_book("Web Development")
    
    # Borrow books
    if alice and python_book:
        print(alice.borrow_book(python_book))
        print(alice.borrow_book(web_book))
    
    # Show member's books
    if alice:
        print(alice.get_borrowed_books())
    
    # Show available books
    print(lib.show_available_books())
    
    # Return a book
    if alice and python_book:
        print(alice.return_book(python_book))
    
    # Show available books again
    print(lib.show_available_books())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## 8. Best Practices and Project Structure

### Project Structure

```
library_project/
│
├── main.py           # Main application
├── library.py        # Library class
├── book.py          # Book class
├── member.py        # Member class
├── utils.py         # Helper functions
└── README.md        # Project description
```

### Best Practices

1. **Use Clear Names**
   ```python
   # Good
   class BankAccount:
       def calculate_interest(self):
           pass
   
   # Bad
   class BA:
       def calc_int(self):
           pass
   ```

2. **Keep Methods Small**
   ```python
   # Good - one responsibility per method
   def validate_email(self, email):
       return "@" in email and "." in email
   
   def send_welcome_email(self, email):
       if self.validate_email(email):
           # send email logic
           pass
   ```

3. **Use Docstrings**
   ```python
   class Student:
       """Represents a student with grades and personal information."""
       
       def calculate_gpa(self):
           """Calculate and return the student's GPA based on grades."""
           pass
   ```

4. **Follow the Single Responsibility Principle**
   - Each class should do **one thing well**
   - Each method should have **one clear purpose**

5. **Use Composition over Inheritance**
   ```python
   # Good - Composition
   class Car:
       def __init__(self):
           self.engine = Engine()  # Car HAS an engine
   
   # Sometimes better than inheritance
   class SportsCar(Car):  # SportsCar IS A Car
       pass
   ```

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Making everything public**
2. **Creating god classes** (classes that do too much)
3. **Not using inheritance when it makes sense**
4. **Overusing inheritance when composition is better**
5. **Forgetting to call `super().__init__()`** in child classes

### Testing Your Code

```python
# test_library.py
def test_book_borrowing():
    from book import Book
    
    book = Book("Test Book", "Test Author", "123")
    result = book.borrow("John")
    
    assert book.is_borrowed == True
    assert book.borrowed_by == "John"
    assert "borrowed by John" in result
    
    print("✅ Book borrowing test passed!")

def test_member_book_limit():
    from member import Member
    from book import Book
    
    member = Member("Test Member", "M999")
    
    # Try to borrow 4 books (limit is 3)
    for i in range(4):
        book = Book(f"Book {i}", "Author", f"ISBN{i}")
        result = member.borrow_book(book)
        
        if i < 3:
            assert "borrowed by" in result
        else:
            assert "Cannot borrow more than 3" in result
    
    print("✅ Member book limit test passed!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_book_borrowing()
    test_member_book_limit()
    print("All tests passed! 🎉")
```

## Summary and Key Takeaways

### What We've Learned

1. **Classes and Objects** - How to create blueprints and instances
2. **Encapsulation** - Protecting data with private attributes
3. **Inheritance** - Reusing code through parent-child relationships
4. **Polymorphism** - Same method names, different behaviors
5. **Composition** - Building complex objects from simpler ones

### Real-World Applications

- **Web Applications** - User classes, Product classes
- **Games** - Player classes, Enemy classes, Weapon classes
- **Business Software** - Employee classes, Order classes
- **Mobile Apps** - Profile classes, Message classes

### Next Steps

1. **Practice** building more classes
2. **Learn about** abstract base classes
3. **Explore** design patterns (Factory, Observer, etc.)
4. **Study** frameworks like Django (uses lots of OOP)
5. **Build** your own projects using these concepts

### Quick Reference

```python
# Class template
class MyClass:
    # Class variable
    class_var = "shared by all"
    
    def __init__(self, param):
        self.param = param      # Public
        self._protected = None  # Protected (convention)
        self.__private = None   # Private
    
    def public_method(self):
        return "Anyone can call this"
    
    def _protected_method(self):
        return "Convention: internal use"
    
    def __private_method(self):
        return "Hard to access from outside"
    
    @property
    def param(self):
        return self._param
    
    @param.setter
    def param(self, value):
        if value > 0:
            self._param = value

# Inheritance
class ChildClass(MyClass):
    def __init__(self, param, extra):
        super().__init__(param)
        self.extra = extra
    
    def public_method(self):  # Override
        return "Child version"
```

**Remember**: OOP is about **modeling real-world problems** in code. Start simple, practice often, and gradually build more complex applications!

### 🎯 Final Challenge

Create a simple **School Management System** with:
- `Person` base class
- `Student` and `Teacher` child classes
- `Course` class
- `School` class that manages everything

This will test everything you've learned! Start with the basic structure and gradually add features.

**Happy Coding!** 🐍✨
